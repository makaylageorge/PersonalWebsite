									 As  credit policy analyst, I was given access to databases that contained information on user attributes and behavior.
									 I was able to utilize SQL to organize millions of entries and to pull insights from the data. By looking at credit
									 policy applications in combination with customer behavior, I was able to identify specific attributes that often
									 pointed towards a customer being more risky (prone to delinquency or charge off). I noticed that specific channels
									 drew in more customers with unfavorable behavior, and if we were to tighten policy in these specific channels, we could
									 reduce risk to the company and increase profitability.

												Your first internship will challenge you in ways you would never expect. No classroom experience can
												truly compare to having to practically apply concepts to real life projects and challenges. Prepare
												to be uncomfortable, prepare to make mistakes, and prepare to grow. There is no “failing” at your first internship,
												because everything you do (no matter how successful) is a new experience under your belt and a
												learning opportunity!

												This internship was my first experience working in a corporate setting and it was great learning how to
												 function in this environment. During my time in the office I was able to connect with amazing meteors
												 and learn from their professional experiences. My biggest takeaway was that your background does not
												 determine your future. I met so many successful  analysts that came from backgrounds such as engineering,
												 economics, and investment banking. Through these conversations, I gained the confidence and
												perspective to pivot from pursuing careers in analytics to exploring the field of product management.

									 Go to office hours! I know everyone will give this advice to new students, but I say this again in hopes that someone
									  reading this will take my advice. As a TA, I spent most of my time sitting alone in my office because students
										 would not come in until the week a project was released. The teaching staff wants to help you, so do not be afraid
										 to reach out and utilize us as a resource . Your TAs can advise you on things such as internships and class
										  scheduling, conversations don't have to be limited to only homework. I really wish I got the
											opportunity to connect with more students while working in this position.

									 One has not truly mastered something until they can teach it. Finishing the class with a near perfect grade,
									 did not prepare me in any way to be a teacher. Through working in this position, I learned that being a teacher
									 is a collaborative experience. Everyone learns in different ways, and there are multiple ways to approach a
									problem. By working one on one with students you gain insights into creative and innovative ways to solve a
									problem that you would not have otherwise considered. Through teaching in this way, you also empower
									students to think outside the box and ensure that everyone feels as though their opinions are valued.

									 I served on the student board of my honors college for two years and it was an extremely rewarding experience.
									 As social chair, I worked to plan events (professional, social, and educational) and establish a sense of
									 community within our living learning program. As social chair I conducted corporate outreach to acquire speakers
									  for events, and handled other logistics. My favorite events that I planned were a Women in Cybersecurity Panel
										and the first annual ACES talent show. I also worked with our student body to advocate for changes in policy
										and curriculum.

												My greatest takeaway from this experience was learning how to work collaboratively with others to do what

												 best way to do something and at times it was tough navigating through many opinions. I have learned that
												 allowing opportunities for ownership and openness to compromise are key to performing best in group settings.

								 <div class="column">
									 Always make time for your passions, especially ones that fall outside of your current career path. Cheerleading
									 has always been the thing that makes me happiest and I have been active in the sport since I was 7, but as
									 I have progressed in my career and education it has become increasingly harder to find time for it. It's
									 important not to lose sight of the things that bring you the most joy, no matter how successful you may become.
									 If you have the opportunity to do the things you love, in any capacity, don't take it for granted.
