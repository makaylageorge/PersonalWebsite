								<h4>Intro to Information Systems</h4>
								<h4>BMGT301</h4>

								<p>
									Prior to this class, I didn't fully understand what differentiated Information Systems from other similar fields. I chose
									this major because I knew that it laid somewhere on the intersection of Business and Technology. During this class
									I explored the true potential of a degree in IS. I learned how companies could create a sustainable competitive
									advantage by leveraging technology. I also learned the importance that big data and technology have when trying to capture
									 consumers, differentiate offerings, and streamline customer experience. While covering these topics, I also
									  completed coursework in Excel and worked towards a certification. After finishing top of my class, I was offered a
										position as a TA and was given the opportunity to be a leader and mentor to other IS students.
										<br><br>
									<b> Skills: Excel </b>
								</p>
								<hr />
								<h4>Essential Programming Skills for Business Analytics</h4>
								<h4>BMGT302</h4>
								<p>
									In this class I was able to build on the foundation that I gained in 301 and dive into object oriented
									programming. Our projects focused on building business applications in Python. I loved getting to work on
									 my problem solving skills through coding and finding creative ways to approach a challenge. In this
									  class I also learned the fundamentals of VBA. By combining VBA and Excel I was able to build
										 applications that made data manipulation and visualization easier for users.
									<br><br>
									<b>Skills: Python, VBA</b>

								<h4>Pocketbook Politics: A History of American Buying and Selling</h4>
								<h4>HIST289R</h4>
								<p>
									Originally, I enrolled in this class to fulfill a general education requirement but I soon became deeply engrossed in dissecting
									American consumerism. During the semester we looked at how consumerism progressed over time, and how the US evolved
									from a colonial society to a global consumer society. In this class I studied the political aspects of consumerism
									and the power the American public has. For my capstone I explored the impact that consumers had on the success of
									the civil rights movement.

								<h4>Applied Cybersecurity Foundations II</h4>
								<h4>HACS200</h4>
								<p>
									In todayâ€™s world, is it ever possible to be completely secure when operating in an online space? During
									my undergraduate studies I undertook an honors citation in cybersecurity. In this capstone class we worked
									in groups and conducted research on a topic of our choosing. For our project, we wanted to explore the
									 impact that language had on the behavior of a cyber attacker. We hypothesized that the language of a system
									 (Chinese, English, and Russian) had a significant impact on how an attacker behaved within a system. As a
									 team we developed honeypots, created "dummy data", collected data with montitoring scripts, and conducted statistical tests. In this
									 class I was able to grow in my collaboration and teamwork skills.

									<h4>Strategy Consulting</h4>
									<h4>B3MIN1022</h4>
									<p>
									The Dutch education system stood out from that of the US in that all classes were case and application based.
									While completing my minor in consulting I was given the opportunity to directly apply what we learned in the
									classroom to real business problems. For our capstone project we worked with a team to find a local company,
									diagnose a strategic issue they had, and propose a solution. We partnered with a bubble tea shop and were
									 given access to our clients financial, sales, and product data. With this data and other research, we were
									 able to conduct a competitive analysis and create an actionable plan for them to increase differentiation and
									  capture a larger market share.
